# This is our README :)

## Questions:
1) Do we need to prioritze building the Calender integration or the Event recomendation (using hard coded events)first? Recommendation is core to our project but the calender integration is essential for actual use
2) How much of the Calender/Event structure do we need to write and how much do we get from Google API (what is the power of APIs?)
